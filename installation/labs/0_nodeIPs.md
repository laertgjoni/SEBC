I had to use my company's amazon account, using it with my colleague Maurizio Caselle.
I made sure that each node had 30gb of disk space available.
To check that the version was compatible with CDH 5.8.3 i used the following command -> cat /etc/redhat-release which resulted in "CentOS release 6.9 (Final)"
I used 5 out of the 10 nodes created:

35.157.161.230
52.57.162.172
35.158.171.255
18.194.212.169
35.158.171.100
